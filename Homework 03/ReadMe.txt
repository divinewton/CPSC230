1. TotalPrice
This code asks the user to input the price of an item and outputs the price with tax added. 
It uses a while loop to ensure the entered value is a number and is above zero. 
It then adds the price times the tax to find the total price and outputs the value.

2. Celsius
This code asks the user to input the current temperature in Fahrenheit, and outputs the temperature converted into Celsius.
It first uses a while loop to ensure the entered value is a number and is within known earth temperatures (between -130 and 135 Fahrenheit)
It then uses the common celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9 formula to output the answer to the user. 

3. fishVSfishes
This code asks the user to input three individual fish names, and lets the user know whether to use "fish" or "fishes" as their plural.
It adds the names to a set and uses an if statement with len to determine if the names are the same. 
If they are all the same, it outputs "fish," if not, it outputs "fishes."
