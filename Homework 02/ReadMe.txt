1. TotalPrice.py
This code asks the user to input the price of an item and outputs the price with tax added.
It converts the input to a float and then adds the price times the tax to find the total price.

2. Celsius.py
This code asks the user to input the current temperature in Fahrenheit and outputs the temperature converted into Celsius.
It converts the temp to a float and uses the common Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9 formula to output the answer.

3. SquareCentimeters.py
This code takes the input of a tank's volume measurement and outputs the tank's footprint.
The program does this by converting the volume to centimeters, then finding the side of the tank (through cube root) and then getting the area (through squaring).
